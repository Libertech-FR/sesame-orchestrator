configuration de base pour les services de traitement de files d'attente dans une application NestJS. Elle intègre des fonctionnalités de gestion de file d'attente en utilisant bullmq et Redis.\nDépendances\n\nConfigService : Service de @nestjs/config pour accéder aux variables de configuration.\nRedis : Client Redis pour interagir avec un serveur Redis.\n\nPropriétés\n\nqueue (Queue) : Instance de Queue de bullmq, représentant la file d'attente à traiter.\nqueueEvents (QueueEvents) : Instance de QueueEvents de bullmq, utilisée pour gérer les événements liés à la file d'attente.\n\nConstructeur\nExample :public constructor(\n  protected readonly config: ConfigService,\n  protected readonly redis: Redis,\n) {\n  this.queue = new Queue(this.config.get('nameQueue'), {\n    connection: this.redis,\n  });\n  this.queueEvents = new QueueEvents(this.config.get('nameQueue'), {\n    connection: this.redis,\n  });\n}Paramètres\n\nconfig (ConfigService):  Service de configuration pour accéder aux variables de configuration de l'application.\nredis (Redis): Instance du client Redis pour se connecter au serveur Redis.\n\nDescription\nInitialise les propriétés queue et queueEvents en créant de nouvelles instances de Queue et QueueEvents, en utilisant la configuration nameQueue pour le nom de la file d'attente et l'instance Redis pour la connexion.\nMéthodes\nCeci est une classe abstraite et n'implémente pas de méthodes. Les classes dérivées doivent implémenter une logique spécifique de traitement de file d'attente.\nUtilisation\nÉtendez cette classe dans les services qui nécessitent des capacités de traitement de file d'attente. Implémentez la logique de traitement des éléments dans la file d'attente dans le service étendu.\nExample :import Redis from 'ioredis';\nimport { InjectRedis } from 'nestjs-ioredis';\nimport { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';\nimport { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { AbstractQueueProcessor } from '~/_common/abstracts/abstract.queue.processor';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class ExampleQueueService extends AbstractQueueProcessor {\nconstructor(\n    protected readonly configService: ConfigService,\n    @InjectRedis() protected readonly redis: Redis,\n)  {\n        super(configService, redis);\n   }\n\n    async example(params: any) {\n        const job = await this.queue.add('EXEMPLE', params);\n        this.queueEvents.on('failed', (errors) => {\n            console.log(errors);\n        });\n        return await job.waitUntilFinished(this.queueEvents, 30000);\n    }\n}\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
