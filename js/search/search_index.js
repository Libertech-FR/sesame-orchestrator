entre différentes sources de données, y compris des bases de données, des annuaires LDAP/Active Directory et des applications tierces, vers des serveurs OpenLDAP ou Active Directory. Le projet se compose de deux modules principaux : l'orchestrateur et le démon.\nArchitecture du projet\nFigma\nModules\nOrchestrateur\n\nGère la synchronisation des identités.\nMaintient une base d'identités pour faciliter la synchronisation.\nPermet la configuration de schémas additionnels pour une flexibilité totale.\nExpose des entrypoints via une API REST avec des tokens JWT.\n\nDeamon\n\nDéclenche les scripts backend pour effectuer les opérations de synchronisation.\nUtilise BullMQ et Redis pour communiquer avec l'orchestrateur.\n\nSchémas d'Identité\n\nUtilise le schéma LDAP InetOrgPerson pour stocker les informations dans une base de données MongoDB.\nPossibilité de configurer des schémas additionnels pour des champs différents dans chaque enregistrement.\nPermet de définir le typage, les règles, et la présence des champs dans les identités.\nSchémas optionnels tels que Supann et/ou Renater pour une utilisation fréquente.\n\nTechnologies utilisées\n\nLangages : NodeJS et NestJS.\nCommunication Démon-Orchestrateur : BullMQ et Redis.\nAuthentification Orchestrateur : Comptes stockés dans MongoDB, mots de passe dans un serveur tiers (OpenLDAP).\nBackends : Scripts système en Python, PowerShell, Perl, Bash, etc.\n\nInterfaces Utilisateur\n\nFrontend : Interfaces permettant la configuration de l'orchestrateur et la manipulation des données à importer.\n\nConclusion\nSésame offre une solution puissante et flexible pour la synchronisation d'identités à partir de diverses sources vers des serveurs cibles. Son architecture modulaire et ses fonctionnalités avancées en font un outil idéal pour les environnements complexes nécessitant une gestion fine des schémas et des processus de synchronisation.\nVariables d'environnements\nExample :#Host Redis\nREDIS_HOST=redis\n#Port Redis\nREDIS_PORT=6379\n# redis credentials (si ces variables n existe pas, pas d'authentification par

Dans ce document, nous allons prendre comme exemple le service IdentitiesService et le modèle Identities.\nCette methode ne fonctionne que pour les services CRUD qui héritent d'AbstractServiceSchema.\nPrérequis\n\nNode.js\nNestJS\nJest\nMongoDB Memory Server\n\nStubs\nLes stubs sont utilisés pour simuler des données dans les tests. Les stubs sont créés dans le dossier stubs au sein du module ou se trouve le test et sont utilisés dans les tests.\nExemple\nExample :import { IdentitiesUpdateDto } from './../_dto/identities.dto';\nimport { IdentitiesDto } from '~/management/identities/_dto/identities.dto';\nimport { IdentityLifecycle } from '~/management/identities/_enums/lifecycle.enum';\nimport { IdentityState } from '~/management/identities/_enums/states.enum';\nimport { additionalFieldsPartDtoStub } from './_parts/addtionalFields.dto.stub';\nimport { inetOrgPersonDtoStub } from './_parts/inetOrgPerson.dto.stub';\n\nexport const IdentitiesDtoStub = (): IdentitiesDto => {\n  return {\n    state: IdentityState.TO_CREATE,\n    lifecycle: IdentityLifecycle.INACTIVE,\n    inetOrgPerson: inetOrgPersonDtoStub(),\n    additionalFields: additionalFieldsPartDtoStub(),\n  };\n};\n\nexport const IdentitiesUpdateDtoStub = (): IdentitiesUpdateDto => {\n  const inetOrgPerson = inetOrgPersonDtoStub();\n  inetOrgPerson.cn = 'updated-cn';\n  return {\n    state: IdentityState.TO_CREATE,\n    lifecycle: IdentityLifecycle.INACTIVE,\n    inetOrgPerson,\n    additionalFields: additionalFieldsPartDtoStub(),\n  };\n};Ici pour clarifier les données, nous avons déporté une partie des données dans des fichiers séparés stocké dans le dossier _parts du dossier stubs.\nVoici un exemple de stub pour inetOrgPersonDtoStub:\nExample :import { inetOrgPersonDto } from '~/management/identities/_dto/_parts/inetOrgPerson.dto';\n\nexport const inetOrgPersonDtoStub = (): inetOrgPersonDto => {\n  return {\n    cn: 'cn',\n    sn: 'sn',\n    uid: 'uid',\n    displayName: 'displayName',\n    facsimileTelephoneNumber: 'facsimileTelephoneNumber',\n    givenName: 'givenName',\n    labeledURI: 'labeledURI',\n    mail: 'mail',\n    mobile: 'mobile',\n    postalAddress: 'postalAddress',\n    preferredLanguage: 'preferredLanguage',\n    telephoneNumber: 'telephoneNumber',\n    title: 'title',\n    userCertificate: 'userCertificate',\n    userPassword: 'userPassword',\n  };\n};Constantes\nLes constantes suivantes sont utilisées dans les tests.\nExample :describe('Identities Service', () => {\n  let mongoDbTestInstance: MongoDbTestInstance;\n  let service: IdentitiesService;\n  let model: Model;\n  let identitiesModel: Model;\n  const _id = new Types.ObjectId();\n  const newIdentityData = {\n    _id,\n    ...IdentitiesDtoStub(),\n  };\n  const updatedIdentityData = {\n    _id,\n    ...IdentitiesUpdateDtoStub(),\n  };\n\n  const options: QueryOptions = {\n    limit: 10,\n    skip: 0,\n    sort: {\n      'metadata.createdAt': 'asc',\n    },\n  };\n  const projection: ProjectionType = {\n    state: 1,\n    inetOrgPerson: 1,\n    additionalFields: 1,\n  };\n  const filter: FilterQuery = {};\n});Utilisation de MongoDbTestInstance\nLa classe MongoDbTestInstance est utilisée pour créer une instance MongoDB temporaire pour les tests.\nFonctions\nstart() démarre une instance MongoDB temporaire pour les tests.\nstop() arrête l'instance MongoDB temporaire.\nclearDatabase() supprime toutes les données de la base de données temporaire.\ngetModel() crée un modèle Mongoose à partir d'un schéma Mongoose.\nConstantes\nmongod: MongoMemoryServer est l'instance MongoDB temporaire.\nmongoConnection: Connection est la connexion à l'instance MongoDB temporaire.\nExemple d'utilisation\nExample :beforeAll(async () => {\n    mongoDbTestInstance = new MongoDbTestInstance();\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.start();\n    identitiesModel = await mongoDbTestInstance.getModel(Identities.name, IdentitiesSchema);\n});\n\nafterEach(async () => {\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.clearDatabase();\n});\n\nafterAll(async () => {\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.stop();\n});Mock du module et créer des modèles simulés avec createMockModel\ncreateMockModel est utilisé pour simuler des modèles Mongoose pour les tests.\nExample :function createMockModel(model: Model, stub, updatedStub?): Modelmodel est le modèle Mongoose à simuler.\nstub est le stub à utiliser pour simuler les données.\nupdatedStub est le stub à utiliser pour simuler les données mises à jour.\nLa fonction retourne un modèle Mongoose simulé.\nExemple\nExample :  beforeEach(async () => {\n    model = createMockModel(identitiesModel, newIdentityData, updatedIdentityData);\n\n    // Mock the module\n    const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({\n      controllers: [IdentitiesController],\n      providers: [\n        IdentitiesService,\n        {\n          provide: getModelToken(Identities.name),\n          useValue: identitiesModel,\n        },\n        IdentitiesValidationService,\n      ],\n      imports: [IdentitiesValidationModule],\n    }).compile();\n\n    // Get the service\n    service = module.get(IdentitiesService);\n  });Assertions dans les tests\nLes fonctions fournies aident à affirmer diverses conditions dans les tests. Ces méthodes sont utilisables uniquement pour les services CRUD qui héritent d'AbstractServiceSchema.\nAssertions findAndCount\nfindAndCountAssertions vérifie la méthode de service findAndCount.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('findAndCount', () => {\n    it('should return an array of identities or throw an error', async () => {\n      findAndCountAssertions(service, model, filter, projection, options, newIdentityData);\n      findAndCountErrorAssertions(service, filter, projection, options);\n    });\n  });Assertions findById\nfindByIdAssertions vérifie la fonctionnalité de la méthode de service findById.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('findById', () => {\n    it('should return a single identity by id or throw an error', async () => {\n      findByIdAssertions(service, model, _id, projection, options, newIdentityData);\n    });\n    it('should return an empty array and count 0 documents', async () => {\n      findByIdErrorAssertions(service, _id, projection, options);\n    });\n  });Assertions findOne\nfindOneAssertions assure le bon fonctionnement de la méthode findOne du service.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('findOne', () => {\n    it('should return a single identity matching the filter or throw an error', async () => {\n      findOneAssertions(service, model, _id, projection, options, newIdentityData);\n    });\n    it('should throw a Notfound error', async () => {\n      findOneErrorAssertions(service, _id, projection, options);\n    });\n  });Assertions create\ncreateAssertions teste la méthode create du service.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('create', () => {\n    it('should create and return a new identity or throw an error', async () => {\n      createAssertions(service, model, newIdentityData, newIdentityData);\n    });\n    it('should throw a Notfound error', async () => {\n      createErrorAssertions(service, newIdentityData);\n    });\n  });Assertions update\nupdateAssertions évalue la fonctionnalité update.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('update', () => {\n    it('should update and return an identity or throw an error', async () => {\n      const updateData = {\n        'field': 'updated-field',\n      };\n      const updateOptions: QueryOptions & { rawResult: true } = {\n        options: options,\n        rawResult: true,\n      };\n\n      updateAssertions(service, model, _id, updateData, updateOptions, updatedIdentityData);\n    });\n    it('should throw a Notfound error', async () => {\n      const updateData = {\n        'field': 'updated-field',\n      };\n      const updateOptions: QueryOptions & { rawResult: true } = {\n        options: options,\n        rawResult: true,\n      };\n\n      updateErrorAssertions(service, _id, updateData, updateOptions);\n    });\n  });Assertions delete\ndeleteAssertions évalue la méthode delete dans le service.\nExemple\nExample :  describe('delete', () => {\n    it('should delete and return the deleted identity or throw an error', async () => {\n      deleteAssertions(service, model, _id, options, newIdentityData);\n    });\n    it('should throw a Notfound error', async () => {\n      deleteErrorAssertions(service, _id, options);\n    });\n  });Exemple complet d'un cas de test\nUn exemple de cas de test pour IdentitiesService en utilisant les méthodes ci-dessus.\nConfiguration du Test\nExample :beforeAll(async () => {\n    mongoDbTestInstance = new MongoDbTestInstance();\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.start();\n    identitiesModel = await mongoDbTestInstance.getModel(Identities.name, IdentitiesSchema);\n});\n\nbeforeEach(async () => {\n    model = createMockModel(identitiesModel, newIdentityData, updatedIdentityData);\n    // Autres configurations de test\n});\n\nafterEach(async () => {\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.clearDatabase();\n    jest.clearAllMocks();\n});\n\nafterAll(async () => {\n    await mongoDbTestInstance.stop();\n});Test d'un controller CRUD\nCette documentation fournit un aperçu détaillé de la fonction utilitaire createMockService, conçue pour faciliter la création de services mock pour les besoins de test dans les applications TypeScript, en mettant un accent particulier sur celles utilisant Jest et NestJS. L'initiation du test est similaire à celle des tests de services au niveau du module et de l'instantiation de la base mongoDB.\nVue d'ensemble\nLa fonction createMockService améliore dynamiquement la création de services mock, permettant de configurer un nombre arbitraire de comportements d'appel de méthode de manière dynamique. Elle simplifie le processus de configuration des implémentations mock pour les méthodes de service, supportant à la fois des valeurs fixes et des comportements dynamiques définis par des fonctions, y compris des comportements asynchrones basés sur des promesses et la gestion des erreurs.\nFonction : createMockService\nBut\nGénérer une instance de service mock avec des méthodes simulées selon les comportements spécifiés, rationalisant le test de divers scénarios incluant le succès, l'échec, et les exceptions.\nParamètres\n\nservice (new (...args: any[]) => T): Le constructeur de la classe de service à mocker. Ce paramètre prend une référence de classe que le service mock va imiter.\n\nmethodStubs (Record): Un objet où les clés représentent les noms des méthodes à mocker, et les valeurs sont les comportements à simuler pour ces méthodes. Ces comportements peuvent être spécifiés comme des valeurs uniques pour un comportement uniforme à travers les appels, des tableaux de valeurs pour définir des comportements séquentiels d'appels, des fonctions pour calculer dynamiquement les valeurs de retour, ou des instances de Error pour simuler des exceptions.\n\n\nRetours\n\nT: Une instance mock de la classe de service (T), avec des méthodes simulées comme spécifié par le paramètre methodStubs.\n\nExemple d'utilisation\nExample :service = createMockService(IdentitiesService, {\n  create: [\n    () => Promise.resolve({ ...IdentitiesDtoStub(), _id, state: IdentityState.TO_VALIDATE }),\n    () => Promise.resolve({ ...IdentitiesDtoStub(), _id, state: IdentityState.TO_COMPLETE }),\n  ],\n  findAndCount: [\n    () => Promise.resolve([[{ ...IdentitiesDtoStub(), _id }], 1]),\n    () => Promise.reject(new Error('Erreur')), // Fonction qui lance une erreur\n  ],\n  // Autres simulations de méthodes...\n});Dans cet exemple, la fonction createMockService est utilisée pour mocker un IdentitiesService avec des comportements spécifiques pour les méthodes create, findAndCount, et d'autres, démontrant comment gérer à la fois les opérations réussies et les erreurs.\nImportance de l'ordre des valeurs retournées : Il est crucial de comprendre que l'ordre des valeurs retournées dans l'exemple a une importance significative car il correspondra à l'ordre des appels dans les tests. Cela signifie que le comportement simulé pour le premier appel sera le premier dans la liste, et ainsi de suite, permettant une simulation précise des scénarios de test.\nRéférences supplémentaires\nCette documentation couvre l'essentiel des tests des services NestJS en utilisant Jest.

Ces instructions sont destinées à des utilisateurs ayant une certaine connaissance technique, notamment en matière de requêtes HTTP.\nEndpoint pour la Création d'Identité\nURL: /management/identities : Adresse de l'endpoint pour la création d'identité.\nMéthode: POST : Verbe HTTP utilisé pour créer une nouvelle ressource.\nHeader Requis : Content-Type: application/json : Indique que le corps de la requête est au format JSON.\nCorps de la Requête (Body)\nLors de la création d'une identité, le corps de la requête doit inclure les informations de base de l'identité (inetOrgPerson), ainsi que tout champ additionnel nécessaire selon l'objectClass spécifique. Notez que l'objet inetOrgPerson est validé en dur et non via un fichier YAML.\nInformations de Base (inetOrgPerson)\nLes informations de base de l'identité sont définies dans l'objet inetOrgPerson. Les champs requis sont cn (Nom Commun), sn (Nom de Famille), et uid (Identifiant Unique). Ces champs sont validés en dur.\nChamps obligatoires :\n\ncn  \nsn\nuid\n\nChamps facultatifs :\n\ndisplayName\nfacsimileTelephoneNumber\ngivenName\nlabeledURI\nmail\nmobile\npostalAddress\npreferredLanguage\ntelephoneNumber\ntitle\nuserCertificate\nuserPassword\n\nChamps Additionnels\nPour les champs additionnels, assurez-vous que les valeurs sont conformes aux attentes du système. Voici comment il se structure :\nExample :{\n  \"additionalFields\": {\n    \"objectClasses\": [],\n    \"attributes\": {}\n  }\n}\nobjectClasses : Un tableau contenant les noms des objectClasses concernées. Par exemple, si vous attendez des informations supann, vous devez inclure une valeur supann en chaine de charactères dans ce tableau.\n\nattributes : Un objet contenant les attributs spécifiques à chaque objectClass. Par exemple, si vous attendez des informations supann, vous devez inclure un objet supann contenant les attributs spécifiques à cette objectClass.\n\n\nATTENTION : Les champs additionnels sont validés via des fichiers de configuration YAML spécifiques à chaque objectClass. Assurez-vous que les valeurs envoyées sont conformes à ces fichiers de configuration pour garantir le succès de la création de l'identité. Ces fichiers de configuration sont définis dans la documentation Validation d'identité et doivent être nommés selon le nom de l'objectClass qu'ils définissent, par exemple supann.yml pour l'objectClass supann.\nExemple de Corps de Requête\nVoici un exemple de corps de requête pour la création d'une identité avec les informations minimales requises et un état (state) défini à -1 pour indiquer une création :\nExample :{\n  \"state\": -1,\n  \"inetOrgPerson\": {\n    \"cn\": \"Nom Commun\",\n    \"sn\": \"Nom de Famille\",\n    \"uid\": \"Identifiant Unique\"\n  },\n  \"additionalFields\": {\n    \"objectClasses\": [\"supann\"],\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"supann\": {\n        \"supannEmpId\": \"123456\",\n        \"supannCivilite\": \"M.\",\n        \"supannBirthName\": \"Dupont\",\n        \"supannBirthDate\": \"1980-12-15\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}Exemple de requete avec cUrl\nExample :curl -X POST \"http:///identities\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n           \"state\": -1,\n           \"inetOrgPerson\": {\n             \"cn\": \"Nom Commun\",\n             \"sn\": \"Nom de Famille\",\n             \"uid\": \"Identifiant Unique\"\n           },\n           \"additionalFields\": {\n             \"objectClasses\": [\"supann\"],\n             \"attributes\": {\n               \"supann\": {\n                 \"supannEmpId\": \"123456\",\n                 \"supannCivilite\": \"M.\",\n                 \"supannBirthName\": \"Dupont\",\n                 \"supannBirthDate\": \"1980-12-15\"\n               }\n             }\n           }\n         }'États (IdentityState)\nLe state doit être défini à -1 pour indiquer une création. Par la suite, le système gère automatiquement l'état de l'identité en fonction des actions de validations ou de syncronisation effectuées sur celle-ci.\nGestion Automatique du lifecycle\nLe cycle de vie de l'identité (lifecycle) est géré automatiquement par le système. Vous n'avez pas besoin de le spécifier dans votre requête.\nRéponse Attendue\nEn cas de succès, le système renvoie un statut 201 Created avec les détails de l'identité créée. Si des informations supplémentaires sont requises, le statut peut être 202 Accepted avec un message indiquant que des champs additionnels sont manquants ou invalides.\nModification de l'identité\nA venir.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/documentation-utilisateur/validation-des-schemas-complémentaires-de-l'identité.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/documentation-utilisateur/validation-des-schemas-complémentaires-de-l'identité.html","title":"additional-page - Validation des schemas complémentaires de l'identité","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation d'Identité\nVue d'ensemble\nLe système de validation d'identité utilise des fichiers de configuration YAML pour définir des règles de validation pour différents types d'objets d'identité. Chaque fichier YAML correspond à une objectClass spécifique et définit les attributs requis et leurs types pour cette classe.\nValidation des champs InetOrgPerson\nLes champs de base de l'objet inetOrgPerson sont validés par défaut. \nChamps obligatoires :\n\ncn  \nsn\nuid\n\nChamps facultatifs :\n\ndisplayName\nfacsimileTelephoneNumber\ngivenName\nlabeledURI\nmail\nmobile\npostalAddress\npreferredLanguage\ntelephoneNumber\ntitle\nuserCertificate\nuserPassword\n\nValidation des champs des schema additionnels\nFichiers de Configuration\nLe fichier de configuration YAML doit être nommé selon le nom de l'objectClass qu'il définit, par exemple supann.yml pour l'objectClass supann. Il doit être placé dans le dossier TBD.\nVous pouvez vous baser sur le template si dessous pour créer votre fichier YAML. Les champs $schema, type, properties et required sont obligatoires. Vpis ajouterez le champs désirés dans properties. Pour les champs requis, vous les listerez dans required.\nExemple Générique de Fichier YAML\nExample :$schema: \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\"\ntype: \"object\"\nproperties:\n    [Nom de l'attribut 1] :\n        description: \"[Description de l'attribut]\"\n        type: [Type de l'attribut]\n        [Autres options]\n    # plus de détails d'attributs...\nrequired:\n    - [Nom de l'attribut 1]\n    - [Nom de l'attribut 2]\n    # plus d'attributs requis...\nExemple de Fichier YAML (supann.yml)\nCe fichier définit la structure et les attributs requis pour l'objectClass supann.\nExample :$schema: \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\"\ntype: \"object\"\nproperties:\n  supannEmpId:\n    type: \"string\"\n    description: \"Employee ID\"\n  supannCivilite:\n    type: \"string\"\n    description: \"Title (Mr, Ms, etc.)\"\n  supannBirthName:\n    type: \"string\"\n    description: \"Birth name\"\n  supannBirthDate:\n    type: \"string\"\n    format: \"date\"\n    description: \"Date of birth\"\n  # plus d'attributs...\nrequired:\n  - \"supannEmpId\"\n  - \"supannCivilite\"\n  - \"supannBirthName\"Options\nChaque attribut peut avoir des options supplémentaires pour définir des règles de validation spécifiques.
